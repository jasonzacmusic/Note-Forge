# Note-Forge

## Overview

Note-Forge is a note-taking application currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains minimal configuration, suggesting this is a newly initialized project intended for building a note management system.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Current State
The project is in early development with only a README file present. No architectural decisions have been made yet.

### Anticipated Architecture (To Be Implemented)

**Frontend**
- Not yet implemented
- Typical note-taking apps use a component-based UI framework (React, Vue, or similar)
- Should support rich text editing, organization (folders/tags), and search functionality

**Backend**
- Not yet implemented
- Will likely need API endpoints for CRUD operations on notes
- Authentication system for user management
- Real-time sync capabilities may be considered

**Data Storage**
- Not yet implemented
- Will require a database schema for:
  - Users (authentication, profiles)
  - Notes (content, metadata, timestamps)
  - Organization structures (folders, tags, categories)
  - Sharing/collaboration settings (if applicable)

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Not yet implemented
- Will need user registration, login, and session management
- May require role-based access for shared notes

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
None currently configured.

### Potential Future Dependencies
- **Database**: Likely to use PostgreSQL, SQLite, or similar relational database
- **ORM/Query Builder**: May use Drizzle, Prisma, or similar for database operations
- **Authentication**: Could integrate Auth0, Clerk, or implement custom JWT-based auth
- **Rich Text Editor**: May integrate libraries like TipTap, Quill, or Draft.js
- **Cloud Storage**: Might use AWS S3, Cloudinary, or similar for attachments/images
- **Search**: Could implement full-text search with database features or integrate services like Algolia

**Note**: This is a greenfield project. All architectural decisions are pending implementation. The code agent should work with the user to establish the tech stack, architecture patterns, and feature set based on their specific requirements.
